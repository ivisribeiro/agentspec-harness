#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Spindle's NATIVE cross-vendor reviewer. Invokes the codex (OpenAI) CLI directly to get
# an independent review of the current work — no third-party Claude plugin required. The
# /codex-review command adapts this output into a `finding` sidecar that the deterministic
# G_REVIEW_BLOCK gate judges. This lives on the MODEL side (a script a command runs); the
# spin spine in src/ never calls a model, so the harness-purity invariant is preserved.
#
# CONFIG — resolved in this order (NO secret ever lives in the repo):
#   1. .spindle/codex.env (gitignored) is sourced first if present — put OPENAI_API_KEY
#      and any knobs there. See docs/codex-review.md for the template.
#   2. the process environment.
#   Knobs:
#     SPINDLE_CODEX_ENABLED   default 1 — set 0 to turn the cross-vendor step off
#     SPINDLE_CODEX_MODEL     optional — passed as `codex exec -m <model>`
#     SPINDLE_CODEX_FLAGS     optional — extra flags for `codex exec`
#   AUTH: codex authenticates via its own `codex login` session OR the OPENAI_API_KEY
#   env var (which .spindle/codex.env may set). Spindle stores no credentials itself.
#
# Usage: codex-review.sh [target]   (target = a path/dir, or "diff" (default))
# Output: codex's raw review on stdout (expected: a JSON array of findings), or a CODEX_*
# marker line. Fail-open: any unmet precondition prints a marker and exits 0 — a missing or
# unconfigured cross-vendor reviewer must never block the run.

You are an independent cross-vendor code reviewer. Review ${TARGET} (if it is "diff",
review the current git diff) for correctness bugs, security vulnerabilities, and design
flaws. Be adversarial: try to find what is wrong, not what is fine.

Output ONLY a JSON array. Each element MUST be:
  {"severity":"critical|high|medium|low","file":"<repo-relative path>","line":<int or null>,"rule":"<short category>","message":"<evidence-grounded explanation>"}
Use "critical" only for a defect that must block the merge. Emit [] if you find nothing.
No prose, no markdown fences — just the JSON array.

# codex exec is the non-interactive one-shot mode; it resolves its own auth (codex login
# or OPENAI_API_KEY). Spindle hardcodes no endpoint and no credential.
#   --skip-git-repo-check: codex refuses to run in a dir it hasn't marked "trusted"
#     unless this is set; since this is a non-interactive (approval: never) call, we pass
#     it so the first /codex-review in any project works without an interactive trust step.
#   </dev/null: the prompt is passed as an arg, so close stdin — otherwise codex exec
#     blocks "Reading additional input from stdin..." when run with no piped input.
